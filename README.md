# Tic-Tac-Toe-Modified
I am a React beginner! 
I was trying to learn to react by building the game from the official tutorial here:https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
I have finished the game and the 6 challenges except challenge 4:
1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

In addition, I have given the user the possibility to make the rows more than 3 by simply typing whatever the number he/she wants (up to 20). 
There is a warning that I did not work on it yet, but the game should work. I hope you would like it!
